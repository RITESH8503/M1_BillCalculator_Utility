# REQUIREMENTS

#INTRODUCTION:
 The Electricity Bill calculator project is the application based mini project, which is used to predict the electricity bill of next month by taking input of appliance or load used. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach Linux and Windows.

 #RESEARCH
 this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming months,, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:
 
 *Declare total unit consumed by the customer 
 .If the unit consumed less or equal to 50 units
 .If the unit consumed between 50 to 150 units
 .If  the unit consumed between 150 to 250 units
  .If the unit consumed above 250 units 


  #In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:
  * Urban
  * Rural
  * industrial
  * for farmers

  SWOT analysis:

  1. STRENGTH
    * Innovative, User-friendly, Simple
=======
  1. STRENGTH * Innovative, User-friendly, Simple
  2  Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.,

  3  Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
