Behavioral Diagrams

UML’s  behavioral diagrams are used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the dynamic aspects of a system. It shows how the system behaves and interacts with itself and other entities (users, other systems). They show how data moves through the system, how objects communicate with each other, how the passage of time affects the system, or what events cause the system to change internal states. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems.  the activity diagram describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the components in a system.

 A behavioral diagram shows how the system works ‘in motion’, that is how the system interacts with external entities and users, how it responds to input or event and what constraints it operates under. 



 Structural Diagrams



 Structure diagrams depict the static structure of the elements in your system.  It shows the things in the system – classes, objects, packages or modules, physical nodes, components, and interfaces. For example, just as the static aspects of a house encompass the existence and placement of such things as walls, doors, windows, pipes, wires, and vents. 

 they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems.
